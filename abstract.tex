We investigate the application of time-reversed electromagnetic wave propagation
to transmit energy in a wireless power transmission system. ``Time reversal'' is
a signal focusing method that exploits the time reversal invariance of the lossless
wave equation to direct signals onto a single point inside a complex scattering
environment. In this work, we explore the properties of time reversed microwave 
pulses in a low-loss ray-chaotic chamber. We measure the spatial profile of the 
collapsing wavefront around the target antenna, and demonstrate that time reversal 
can be used to transfer energy to a receiver in motion. We demonstrate how nonlinear 
elements can be controlled to selectively focus on one target out of a group. 
Finally, we discuss the design of a rectenna for use in a time reversal system.
We explore the implication of these results, and how they may be applied in future
technologies.
