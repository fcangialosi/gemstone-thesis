\section{Anticipated TR WPT System}
\label{sec:future-roadmap}
\todo{Let's think of a better name!}

This research represents a first step in the exploration of building a
time reversal WPT system.
%
We demonstrate one possible realization of this idea in Fig.~\ref{fig:SysImage}.


The proposed system consists of two basic components.
%
The first is a rectenna that serves as the receiver.
%
The system as described in Section~\ref{sec:ltr-meth} would require an
out-of-band feedback channel between the receiver and transmitter. However, we
have demonstrated in Section~\ref{sec:selective-sim} that a transmitter can target
receivers entirely in-band.
%
Our system in Fig.~\ref{fig:SysImage} builds on these findings.
%
The second is a transmitter that performs the time reversal process.
%
This component is responsible for recording characteristic signals from the
receiver(s), time reversing the signals, and re-broadcasting them into the
environment.



In a practical system, the rectenna will be integrated into the hardware of a
mobile device, or into an external component that plugs into the battery.
%
The transmitter would  be connected to an external power source, but
could otherwise be located anywhere in the room.

Although not a component of the system, another important consideration in this
scenario is the environment; a low-loss scattering environment is necessary for
time reversal to be effective.

\caption{A notional time reversal WPT system. In the acquistion phase, a new receiver joins the system by broadcasting or emitting a characteristic signal (0). Here, the receiver actively emits a signal, but it is also possible for the transmitter to find a passive target, as shown in~\cite{nltr-wave-chaotic}. In either case, the next sona that the transmitter collects will contain spatial information unique to the receiver's location (1). In the power transfer cycle, the sona is time reversed (2), amplified, and broadcast back into the environment. The amplified signal reconstructs on the receiver (3) and is converted to usable DC power by the rectifier (4). A small fraction of the signal is used to re-broadcast a new characteristic signal (5) into the environment, which will be collected in the next sona (6). The cycle repeats from (2).}

We have demonstrated the underlying concepts of the WPT system depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:SysImage}.
However, much work is necessary to transform this proof-of-concept technology to a functional product that consumers may use.
Future work discussed here falls into one of two categories. The first category includes established TR techniques that may be extended into the field of TR WPT.
The second category includes novel designs proposed by the team applicable only to TR WPT. Both will be discussed below. 

\section{Future work on applying other techniques from TR to WPT}
\label{sec:future-tr}
\todo{Is this redundant with the intro? Also, kinda awkward, but I can't think of anything better}
Imaging of objects and non-invasive surgery have been major applications of TR in the past.
As a result  many techniques have been developed to improve reconstruction quality on a target.
We suspect that many of these techniques may have applicability to our proposed system, but did not
have the opportunity to investigate them in our research.
However, stationary TR methods have different design priorities than our proposed TR WPT system.
These differences are significant enough that we suggest that dedicated experiments for WPT applicability may be useful.

\subsection{Iterations}

It has been well proven in the literature that time reversal focusing on an object can be repeated to improve
waveform collapse on a target. \todo{cite a fink acoustic paper showing this} \todo{We need to define what ``improved waveform collapse'' is} However, this technique has not been applied to TR WPT.

We suspect that applying
